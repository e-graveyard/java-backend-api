 * it is called if a method is annotated with Logged, it doesn't do anything.  The filter
 * method gets called <b>before</b> the contents of the response are written.  The
 * ResponseInterceptor really logs what is going on.
 * <p>
 * Having said that, if you need to do something to the response before it is committed,
 * this is the place.
